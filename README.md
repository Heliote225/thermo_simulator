Hi everyone!
you want to try our thermometer, Hemecue and glucometer simulator?
Here we will use (raspberry pi + ST7735 screen + pushing button)
After connecting all the devices quoted above, you should follow those steps to deploy the program correctly in the raspberry pi

STEP 1
  download if it not already done this repository using: git clone https://github.com/Heliote225/thermo_simulator

STEP 2
  enter into the folder thermo_simulator using: cd thermo_simulator
  
STEP 3
  launch file start.sh using: start.sh
  
STEP 4
  you can now delete le folder thermo_simulator using: rm thermo_simulator
  
STEP 5
  restart the raspberry pi
  
Now the project is correctly deployed!

All you have to do now is opening a navigator on another device (Computer or Mobile phone) and enter the local ip adress of your raspberry pi.

Have fun!!!
